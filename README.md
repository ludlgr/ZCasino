# ZCasino

A simple casino roulette-like game currently in Python. This project is heaviliy based on chapter 9 of the book ["Apprenez Ã  programmer en Python"](https://www.eyrolles.com/Informatique/Livre/apprenez-a-programmer-en-python-9782212678710/) by Vincent Le Goff.

The goal for this project is for it to be a way to track my progress as I improve my mastery of Python and software engineering and update it.
